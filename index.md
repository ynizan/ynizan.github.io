# Gov123

## Executive Summary

**The Stripe for Government Transactions**

Gov123 is building the enabling layer for companies and AI agents that need to interact with government systems. Like Stripe simplified online payments, we're simplifying government interactions.

### What We Do

We provide a unified API for dealing with hundreds of request types (permits, applications, fines, renewals, licenses) across thousands of jurisdictions.

Think of us as:
- **Stripe** for government transactions
- **Composio** for government skills - providing AI agents with the capabilities to navigate bureaucracy

### The Opportunity

Every business and individual interacts with government systems regularly:
- Business licenses and permits
- Tax filings and compliance
- Professional certifications
- Property permits
- Contractor licenses
- Health department approvals

Currently, each interaction requires understanding specific forms, deadlines, fees, and procedures for each jurisdiction.

### Our Solution

A single API that handles:
- ✅ Form identification and completion
- ✅ Deadline tracking and reminders
- ✅ Fee calculation and payment processing
- ✅ Status monitoring and updates
- ✅ Document management and storage
- ✅ Compliance verification

### Why Now?

1. **AI Agent Economy**: AI agents need structured ways to complete real-world tasks
2. **Digital Transformation**: Governments are modernizing systems but creating fragmented experiences
3. **Remote Work**: Businesses operate across multiple jurisdictions more than ever
4. **Complexity Growth**: Regulations and requirements continue to multiply
